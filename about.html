  <h1>Autism Crash Course - About This Site</h1>
  <h5><a href="index.html">Return Home</a></h5>
  
  <p>This site is meant to be a resource by Autistic people, for people just discovering that they are Autistic. We're hoping it helps explain some of what you're suddenly learning about and takes a little bit of the guesswork out of figuring out what Autism actually is, and could help you chart a path forward to being a healthier person.</p>
  
  <p>The reason we're making this site is because the internet is massively littered by medical and parental resources about Autism, drowning out the many voices of the <i>actual Autistic community</i> and trying to assume what we actually need. Some of it is correct and there are neurotypical people that can understand how we operate, but there is a lot of misinformation out there, even coming from professionals who claim to understand us best. The fact is it is hard to understand Autism without an Autistic brain, and there are lots of amazing resources made by us, for us and our loved ones that are massively helpful for those exploring the neurotype. That said, we're human too, so some of the information here may not be perfect either, but at least we have the first-hand experience to back it up, so we hope to have an emphasis on community resources here, with some professional stuff sprinkled in where applicable. (Some of us are medical professionals as well, which is great and helping to advance everyone's understanding!)</p>

  <p>We try to remain open minded here. If you see something that is off that this site claims, or something offensive, open an issue on GitHub or submit a pull request. It's better for there to be an open discussion about it if it's offending people, we can come to a mutual understanding and make changes if needed.</p>

  <p>It should go without saying that this site's contents are reflective of its contributors, and do not speak for all of Autism around the globe. If you've met one Autistic person, you've met one Autistic person. Our neurotype is a spectrum.</p>

  <p>This site's design is reflective of the preferences of the dev that started it, jclocks. The site is intentionally simple, to avoid technical complexity and the issues that come with it. This may change in the future if there's a good reason for it.</p>
